# Multiple-file-renamer
This simple command make you rename a lot of file in short time, like you "casually have some file that have a certain word behind the name" and you don't want that, with this
you can simply insert the path and the word or phrase to remove, and the program will do all in some seconds even less and 
give you all the file without the word that you have inserted
WARNING!!!
Before executing the python file, you have to have the os library installed for make the program able to run so from a terminal you have to run this command: pip install os

casual error: if you have the folder in the desktop and the program says you some error try inserting in the path ONLY the forder name
(depend on where you have stored this python file)
